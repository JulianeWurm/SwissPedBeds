## Analysis Summary

The script performs:

- Cleaning and transformation of survey data
- Summarisation of bed capacity by hospital and bed type (e.g. ICU, Neonatal, IMC, etc.)
- Calculation of beds per capita by canton and region
- Generation of bar plots and a geographic visualisation of bed distribution

All plots are generated using `ggplot2`, and data summaries are exported to `.csv`.
